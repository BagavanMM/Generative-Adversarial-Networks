# Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs)

In this project, I used Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DGANs) to generate images of hand drawn digits, birds, and faces. <br>The intention behind this project is to get me familiar with Tensorflow and Keras. 

I created an article that talks about how I did this and how you can create your own! <br>
